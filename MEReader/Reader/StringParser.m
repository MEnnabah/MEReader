/*
 **Notes about the parser.**
 - It might accept NSAttributedString for easier paragraph splitting.
 - NSAttributedString shows the string with their font family.
 - Reading from NSAttributedString paragraphs reads a word with hyphen space when the word is has no enough space to be represented in one line.
  We might use regex to exclude unwanted characters.
 - We might split our string into paragraphs and add them to array.
 - Each paragraph element should have the start and end index of the paragraph in the entire string.
